= JAX-RS & Swagger Example

This example builds on the JAX-RS and ShrinkWrap example.
They both have JAX-RS resource implementations and deploy
them through a user-provided `main()` programatically without
construction a `.war` file during the build.

This example builds on that by adding the `swagger` fraction
so that the JAX-RS API is exposed through the /swagger.json
URL.

== Project `pom.xml`

The project is a normal maven project with `jar` packaging, not `war`.

[source,xml]
----
<packaging>jar</packaging>
----

The project adds a `<plugin>` to configure `wildfly-swarm-plugin` to
create the runnable `.jar`.

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
  <artifactId>wildfly-swarm-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>${version.wildfly-swarm}</version>
  <configuration>
    <mainClass>org.wildfly.swarm.examples.jaxrs.shrinkwrap.Main</mainClass>
  </configuration>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <goals>
        <goal>package</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
----

To define the needed parts of WildFly Swarm, dependencies are added

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
  <artifactId>jaxrs</artifactId>
  <version>${version.wildfly-swarm}</version>
</dependency>
----

This dependency allows usage of ShrinkWrap APIs within the `main()` in addition
to providing the JAX-RS APIs.

For the swagger dependency, the `pom.xml` file needs

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
  <artifactId>swagger</artifactId>
  <version>${project.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

== Project `main()`

Since this project deploys JAX-RS resources without a `.war` being constructed, it
provides its own `main()` method (specified above via the `wildfly-swarm-plugin`) to
configure the container and deploy the resources programatically.

[source,java]
----
include::src/main/java/org/wildfly/swarm/examples/jaxrs/swagger/Main.java[lines=12..29]
----

See: link:src/main/java/org/wildfly/swarm/examples/jaxrs/swagger/Main.java#L12[Main.java]

This method constructs a new default Swarm container, which automatically
initializes all fractions (or subsystems) that are available.

A `SwaggerArchive` is constructed, and the JAX-RS resource class is
added to it.

The resources to be exposed by `swagger.json` are specified using
a comma-separated list of package names. In this case, we only have
a single package containing JAX-RS resources that we are interested
in exposing, which is specified like so:

[source,java]
----
archive.setResourcePackages("org.wildfly.swarm.examples.jaxrs.swagger");
----

The Swarm container is then started with the deployment.

By default, if no JAX-RS `Application` is provided a default is added
to the deployment specifying an `@ApplicationPath("/")` to bind the
deployment to the root URL.

We could modify the above `main()` method with:

[source,java]
----
deployment.addClass(MyApp.class);
----

to provide our own JAX-RS `Application`, which would modify the path to be
`http://localhost:8080/taco`.

== Swagger Annotations

The JAX-RS API in this example is exposed in the `swagger.json` format
by using the annotations provided by swagger itself. See the swagger wiki
for complete documentation https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki/Annotations-1.5.X.

In our example, we annotate the JAX-RS resource as so:

[source,java]
----
include::src/main/java/org/wildfly/swarm/examples/jaxrs/swagger/TimeResource.java[lines=12..27]
----

See: link:src/main/java/org/wildfly/swarm/examples/jaxrs/swagger/TimeResource.java#L12[TimeResource.java]

By pointing your browser at http://localhost:8080/swagger.json you should see the
API documented similar to this.

[source,json]
----
{
    "swagger":"2.0",
    "info":{"version":"1.0.0"},
    "host":"localhost:8080",
    "basePath":"/swagger",
    "tags":[{"name":"time"}],
    "schemes":["http"],
    "paths": {
        "/time/now": {
            "get": {
                "tags":["time"],
                "summary":"Get the current time",
                "description":"Returns the time as a string",
                "operationId":"get",
                "produces":["application/json"],
                "parameters":[],
                "responses": {
                    "200": {
                        "description":"successful operation",
                        "schema":{"type":"string"}
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

== Run

You can run it many ways:

* mvn package && java -jar ./target/example-jaxrs-swagger-swarm.jar
* mvn wildfly-swarm:run
* In your IDE run the `org.wildfly.swarm.examples.jaxrs.swagger..Main` class

== Use

To `GET` the JAX-RS resouce

    http://localhost:8080/time/now

To `GET` the API specification as a `swagger.json` document

    http://localhost:8080/swagger.json
