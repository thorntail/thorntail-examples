= Resource Adapter via Deployment.

> Please raise any issues found with this example in our JIRA:

This example demonstrates how to deploy a resource adapter as
a _deployment_.

== Project `pom.xml`

The project is a normal maven project with `jar` packaging, not `war`.

[source,xml]
----
<packaging>jar</packaging>
----

The project adds a `<plugin>` to configure `wildfly-swarm-plugin` to
create the runnable `.jar`.  

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
  <artifactId>wildfly-swarm-plugin</artifactId>
  <configuration>
    <mainClass>org.wildfly.swarm.examples.rar.deployment.Main</mainClass>
  </configuration>
  ...
</plugin>
----
    
As with the other examples, this one inherits a few standard executions
from the parent `pom.xml`, particularly the `package` execution.

To define the needed parts of WildFly Swarm, a few dependencies are added.
To support resource adapters in general, the next dependency is required:
    
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
  <artifactId>resource-adapters</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

Additionally, the RAR archive you wish to deploy is specified as a dependency
within your `pom.xml`

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>net.java.xadisk</groupId>
  <artifactId>xadisk</artifactId>
  <version>1.2.2</version>
  <type>jar</type>
</dependency>
----

Note, we create the rar archive based on the resource adapter jar.

== Project `main()`

Since this project deploys RAR resources, it provides its own `main()` method  to configure the container and deploy the resources programatically. Additionally, it creates and deploys a rar archive using the jar type of the dependecy above. 

[source,java]
----
include::src/main/java/org/wildfly/swarm/examples/rar/deployment/Main.java[lines=19..40]
----

See: link:src/main/java/org/wildfly/swarm/examples/rar/deployment/Main.java#L19[Main.java]

This method constructs a new default Swarm container, which automatically
initializes all fractions (or subsystems) that are available.  

The resource adapter is created programatically and is then deployed as RARArchive.
Please note that In order to initialize a rar deployment, Wildfly excepts an ironjacamar.xml descriptor
as part of the deployment. This is done with the command `rarArchive.resourceAdapter(...)`
Once this is done, the business module which uses the rar can be deployed in a second step.

JNDI names are bound automatically.

The resource is injected on run-time:

[source,java]
----
include::src/main/java/org/wildfly/swarm/examples/rar/deployment/FileIOBean.java[lines=9..23]
----

See: link:src/main/java/org/wildfly/swarm/examples/rar/deployment/FileIOBean.java#L9[FileIOBean.java]

== Run

You can run it many ways:

* mvn package && java -jar ./target/example-resource-adapter-deployment-swarm.jar
* mvn wildfly-swarm:run
* In your IDE run the `org.wildfly.swarm.examples.rar.deployment.Main` class
